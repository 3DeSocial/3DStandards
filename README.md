# 3D NFT Standards
Proposed Standards For 3D / Metaverse Components

## Introduction

### What Are Metaverse Components? ###

Metaverse components refers to any 3D asset that can be rendered in a 3D virtual environment.
Examples include: 

Items (Furniture, Scenery, Weapons)
Avatars (Head only, full body, abstract)
Locations (3D scenes)

### What Is A 3D NFT? ###

A 3D NFT is a non-fungible token that documents ownership of a 3D asset, for example - a model created with Blender. 

Owning the NFT gives you access to all the files necessary to load the 3D asset into rendering software where it can be viewed from all directions and interacted with.

NFTs of image files which are images of items created in 3D modeling software are not 3D NFTs unless the 3D model files are linked to the NFT and made available on purchase.

### What Are NFT Standards? ###

There are many possible ways that 3D assest and data pertaining to them could be stored on the DeSo blockchain.

If 3D / metaverse developers off many different applications use the same method to mint, store and read 3D NFT data it will make the metaverse copmonents usable in every metaverse app built on DeSo.

Exammples:

- 3D Merch from a Metaverse concert on one platform could be displayed in a digital gallery in a separate application.
- Trophies earned in a game could be displayed in your personal 3D trophy room.
- Sculptures could be auctioned in a 3D item store, imported to a digital gallery for public viewing and displayed in the 3D section of your personal website.

### Why Do We Need NFT Standards? ###

Web3 and NFTs are new and many individuals an organizations are experimenting with different ways of implementing them.


If future metaverse platforms all use different formats for 3D NFTs it will duplicate the amount of work content creators and developers have to do to ensure compatibility with each others systems.

By encouraging the use of a standard way to implement 3D NFTs we can leverage one of DeSo's greatest strengths - our shared pool of data - to ensure that if a 3D artist mints an NFT, it can instantly be used in all DeSo based metaverse platforms.
